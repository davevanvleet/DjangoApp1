# DjangoApp1
This is a locall library application that will allow for users to create books, look at authors, and display titles of author's books. This application will give the user the ability to determine as to what books are available, on loan, or currently being borrowed for an extended period of time.

Administrative users will have the ability to utilize the DB functionality to add, remove, and modify entries as well as add users and groups accordingly to expand the user base of the application while also allowing to restrict permissions with various group permissions.
